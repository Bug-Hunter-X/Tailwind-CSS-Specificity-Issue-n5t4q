# Tailwind CSS Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected behavior of classes due to specificity conflicts.

The bug involves nested divs with Tailwind classes applied. The inner classes unexpectedly override outer classes, resulting in unexpected styling.

The solution involves understanding Tailwind's class specificity and adjusting the classes to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly.
